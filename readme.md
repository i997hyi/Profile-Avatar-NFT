1. Project Title
Profile Avatar NFT

2. Project Description
The Profile Avatar NFT is a smart contract on the Stacks blockchain that enables users to mint unique profile avatars as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Each avatar is linked to a metadata URI that can represent an image or identity used across decentralized applications (dApps) in the Web3 ecosystem.

3. Project Vision
To empower decentralized identity and personalization by providing users with verifiable, on-chain profile avatars. These NFTs can serve as visual identifiers across dApps, social platforms, and games built on the Stacks blockchain.

4. Future Scope
Implement full SIP-009 compliance with more utility functions (e.g. transfer, owner-of).

Add support for updating avatar metadata.

Integrate with a decentralized storage service like IPFS for storing avatar images.

Add minting fees or on-chain profile linking.

Build a frontend to interact with the NFT minting UI.
